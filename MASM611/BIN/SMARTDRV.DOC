=============< Part 1: Using the SMARTDRV.EXE Disk-Caching Program >=========

     Microsoft Macro Assembler includes SMARTDRV.EXE version 4.0, a
     sophisticated block-oriented disk-caching program that significantly
     improves assembly and link times. SMARTDRV.EXE is not required by MASM,
     but it can reduce the amount of time your computer spends reading data
     from your hard disk. SMARTDRV.EXE replaces the older version,
     SMARTDRV.SYS, and is compatible with all versions of Windows 3.x.

     SMARTDRV.EXE sets aside some expanded or extended memory as a cache for
     its own use. SMARTDRV.EXE uses this disk cache to store the information
     read from the hard disk when an application needs information from your
     hard disk. When an application attempts to read additional information
     from the hard disk, the SMARTDRV.EXE program supplies the information
     directly from its cache instead. If you are using RAMDRIVE.SYS to create
     one or more RAM drives, and are limiting the memory assigned to
     SMARTDRV.EXE as a result, you can increase system speed by reassigning
     some or all of the memory away from the RAM drive and adding it to the
     memory available to SMARTDRV.EXE.

     SMARTDRV.EXE automatically loads itself into HMA under MS-DOS 5.0 if
     EMM386.EXE is loaded and upper-memory blocks are available as a result of
     a DOS=UMB or DOS=UMB,HIGH command in your CONFIG.SYS file. SMARTDRV.EXE
     can also be loaded into HMA with third-party memory managers such as
     386-Max.

     SMARTDRV.EXE must be specified in both your AUTOEXEC.BAT file and
     CONFIG.SYS file because there are actually two device drivers in a single
     file: a double-buffer driver and a disk cache. The double-buffer driver is
     installed in CONFIG.SYS, and the cache component of SMARTDRV.EXE is
     installed in AUTOEXEC.BAT. Some disk controllers do not need double
     buffering; using this option when you do not need it results in a small
     performance penalty. Therefore, once your system is running with
     SMARTDRV.EXE, type:

        SMARTDRV

     at the command-line prompt. SMARTDRV.EXE displays disk-cache status
     information about your system that looks like this:

        Microsoft SMARTDrive Disk Cache version 4.0
        Copyright 1991,1992 Microsoft Corp.

        Cache size: 1,048,576 bytes

            drive   read cache   write cache   buffering
            --------------------------------------------
              A:       yes           no           no
              B:       yes           no           no
              C:       yes           yes          yes
              D:       yes           yes          -

            For help, type "Smartdrv /?".


     Note
     ----
     If every line in the Buffering column is No, then you can safely remove
     the DEVICE statement for SMARTDRV.EXE from your CONFIG.SYS file.

     SMARTDRV.EXE always copies data to your hard disk when you turn off  your
     computer. It also writes all data to the disk when an application calls
     the MS-DOS reset disk function. If you want to force data to be written to
     disk, use the /C command-line option. If you use a third-party program to
     reboot your machine from a batch file, you should make sure you have
     SMARTDRV /C in the batch file prior to the reboot command. Failure to do
     so may cause data loss.

     You can use command-line options to control the size of the cache element
     (/E) and the size of the read-ahead buffer (/B). The read-ahead buffer is
     additional information that SMARTDRV.EXE reads when the application reads
     information from the hard disk. The size must be specified in bytes, and
     the element size must be one of the following: 1024, 2048, 4096, or 8192.
     The read-ahead buffer must be a multiple of the element size, cannot be
     less than the element size, and cannot exceed 32768. The defaults are 8192
     for the element size and 16384 for the read-ahead buffer. Because these
     will occupy conventional or UMB memory space, making them larger reduces
     the memory MS-DOS applications have available.

     You can start the SMARTDRV.EXE program by typing SMARTDRV at the MS-DOS
     prompt before you start Windows, or by placing a command line in your
     AUTOEXEC.BAT file. The syntax is:

        [[drive:]] [[path]]SMARTDRV.EXE[[ [[drive[[+|-]] ]]...]]
                                  [[/E:ElementSize]] [[InitCacheSize]]
                                  [[WinCacheSize]] ]] [[/B:BufferSize]]
                                  [[/C]] [[/R]] [[/L]] [[ /Q]] [[/S]] [[/?]]


     The following list describes the command-line options available for
     SMARTDRV.EXE:

     drive
     -----
     Specify the letter of the disk drive for which you want to
     control caching. If you don't specify a drive letter, floppy disk
     drives are read-cached but not write-cached, hard disk drives
     are read- and write-cashed, and CD-ROM and network drives
     are ignored. You can specify multiple disk drives.

     path
     ----
     Specify the location of the SMARTDRV.EXE file.

     + | -
     -----
     Enable (+) or disable (-) caching. Use the plus (+) and minus (-)
     signs to override the default settings. If you specify a drive let-
     ter without a plus or minus sign, read-caching is enabled and
     write-caching is disabled. If you specify a drive letter followed
     by a plus sign (+), read- and write-caching are enabled. If you
     specify a drive letter followed by a minus sign(-), read- and
     write-caching are disabled.

     /E:ElementSize
     --------------
     Specify in bytes the amount of the cache SMARTDRV.EXE
     moves at a time. This must be greater than or equal to 1, and a
     power of 2. The default value is 8K.

     InitCacheSize
     -------------
     Specify the size in kilobytes of the cache when
     SMARTDRV.EXE starts (before Windows is running). The
     size of the disk cache affects SMARTDRV.EXE's efficiency. In
     general, the larger the cache, the less often SMARTDRV.EXE
     needs to read information from the disk, which speeds up your
     system's performance. If you do not specify an InitCacheSize
     value, SMARTDRV.EXE sets the value according to how
     much memory your system has (see the list following this list).

     WinCacheSize
     ------------
     Limit the amount (in kilobytes) Windows can reduce the cache
     size. Windows reduces the size of the cache to recover memory
     for its own use. Windows and SMARTDRV.EXE then cooper-
     ate to provide optimum use of your system memory. When you
     quit Windows, Windows restores the cache to its normal size.
     The default value depends on how much available memory
     your system has (see the list following this list). If you specify a
     value for InitCacheSize that is smaller than the value specified
     for WinCacheSize, InitCacheSize is set to the same size as
     WinCacheSize.

     /B:BufferSize
     -------------
     Specify the size of the read-ahead buffer. The next time the
     application is to read information from that file, it can read it
     from memory instead. The default size of the read-ahead buffer
     is 16K. Its value can be any multiple of ElementSize.

     /C
     --
     Write all cached information from memory to the hard disk.
     SMARTDRV.EXE writes information from memory to the hard
     disk at times when other disk activity has slowed. You might
     use this option if you are going to turn off your computer, and
     you want to make sure all cached information has been written
     to the hard disk.

     /R
     --
     Clear the contents of the existing cache and restart
     SMARTDRV.EXE.

     /L
     --
     Prevent SMARTDRV.EXE from loading into upper-memory
     blocks (UMBs), even if there are UMBs available. You can use
     this option of you are using MS-DOS version 5.0 or later and
     UMBs are enabled.

     /Q
     --
     Prevent the display of SMARTDRV.EXE information on your
     screen.

     /S
     --
     Display additional information about the status of
     SMARTDRV.EXE.

     /?
     --
     Display online Help about the SMARTDRV.EXE command
     and options.


     The following list shows the default values for InitCacheSize and
     WinCacheSize, depending on the amount of available extended memory on your
     computer.

     Extended Memory   <= 1 MB     <=2 MB     <=4 MB    <=6 MB    <=6 MB

     InitCacheSize     All         1 MB        1 MB      2 MB     2 MB
     WinCacheSize      Zero        256K        512K      1 MB     2 MB


     Note
     ----
     Do not put the SMARTDRV.EXE cache in the expanded memory provided by
     EMM386.EXE. EMM386.EXE uses extended memory to emulate expanded memory
     that other programs can use. Although SMARTDRV.EXE can use this emulated
     expanded memory for its cache, it may not make your program run as quickly
     as it would using extended memory.

     Because the optimal cache size for SMARTDRV.EXE depends on the programs
     you run, and on your system configuration, there is no single best
     setting. You should experiment to find the best cache size for your system
     after saving a copy of your CONFIG.SYS file. For more information, see
     your Windows User's Guide.


=========================< Part 2: Additional Notes >=========================


     Avoiding Data Loss When Using SMARTDRV.EXE
     ------------------------------------------

     SMARTDRV.EXE does not write data to disk immediately. If your computer
     should crash after the time data is written to the cache and before
     the data is written to the disk, data can be lost. Issuing the
     following command causes SMARTDRV to write all data in the cache to
     the disk:

     SMARTDRV /c


     Setup May Not Detect Foreign Disk Cache
     ---------------------------------------
     Setup may install SMARTDRV.EXE if it does not detect the foreign 
     disk cache installed on your system. Remove the DEVICE statements 
     for SMARTDRV.EXE from your AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS files to 
     resolve this problem.


     Programs That May Be Incompatible with SMARTDRV.EXE
     ---------------------------------------------------

     The following applications may be incompatible with SMARTDRV.EXE,
     version 4.0:

     - The Disk Protect feature in Norton Utilities version 6.0

       Do not use the Disk Protect feature in Disk Monitor. If you do,
       you will encounter an error and your system may hang if you try
       to write to the protected drive. If you want to write to and
       cache a protected drive, use the Norton cache program when using
       Disk Monitor.

     - The Calibrate program in Norton Utilities version 6.01

       Calibrate fails on the Disk Mapping test if SMARTDRV is enabled.

     - DoubleDisk from Vertisoft

       Do not enable write-behind caching for DoubleDisk compressed
       partitions.

     - Storage Dimensions SCSI Driver (SSTOR.SYS)

       Using the SSTOR.SYS driver, the SCSI drive appears corrupted when
       SMARTDRV is loaded. The disk's contents are not altered, but they
       are inaccessible when using SMARTDRV.

     The following drivers, installed in a CONFIG.SYS file, are
     incompatible with SMARTDRV.EXE version 4.0:

     - The SuperStor utility from Addstor (SSTORDRV.SYS)

       Do not use the Create Mountable Drive or Mount and Dismount features
       of SuperStor after SMARTDRV is loaded. You must configure your
       SuperStor partitions before loading SMARTDRV. If your AUTOEXEC.BAT
       file includes "mount" configuration commands, make sure that the
       SMARTDRV command line follows the SuperStor configuration command
       lines.

       Also, you will receive read-write errors if you use SMARTDRV to
       cache a SuperStor compressed drive. To prevent SMARTDRV from
       caching the compressed drive, you must include the driver letter-
       option on the SMARTDRV command line.

       For example, if drive C is the uncompressed drive, and drives E
       and F are the compressed SuperStor drives, you would type the
       following command line or include it in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

       smartdrv e- f-

     - The network driver from DNA Networks Inc. (STATION.SYS)

       Using both STATION.SYS and SMARTDRV may cause your system to hang.

     - Versions prior to version 7.x of the driver for the
       Bernoulli Box (RCD.SYS)

       The RCD.EXE program requires that driver RCD.SYS be installed to
       use the Bernoulli Box. When SMARTDRV is running, RCD.EXE does
       not recognize that RCD.SYS has been installed.

     - The Norton Antivirus utility (NAV_.SYS and NAV&.SYS)

       The NAV_.SYS and NAV&.SYS drivers for the Norton Antivirus utility
       may generate "Not enough memory" errors or hang your system when
       loading SMARTDRV.EXE. One workaround is to use the /L command-line
       option to load SMARTDRV.EXE into low memory. An alternative is using
       the /B option with NAV&.SYS to avoid the NAV&.SYS bug that causes
       your system to hang.

     The following driver, installed in an AUTOEXEC.BAT file, is
     incompatible with SMARTDRV.EXE version 4.0:

     - DataMonitor version 7.1 by PC Tools (DATAMON.*)

       Loading DataMonitor after SMARTDRV is installed may cause your
       system to hang.
