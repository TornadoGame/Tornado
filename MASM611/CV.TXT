       Product Information for Microsoft(R) CodeView(TM), Version 4.01
       Copyright (C) 1993, Microsoft Corporation.  All rights reserved.

     This document contains release notes for version 4.01 of Microsoft
     CodeView for MS-DOS(R) and Microsoft Windows(TM) operating systems.
     For more information on Microsoft CodeView, see Part 2, "The CodeView
     Debugger," in the MASM Environment and Tools book.


     Access to Function Code in Libraries
     ------------------------------------
     The MASM CodeView debugger and linker do not guarantee that the
     name of an .OBJ file is the same name the debugger or linker uses
     to access the function code. To be certain of function access, use
     the /f option when compiling. To avoid problems, do not put code in
     include files. If you do put code into include files, specify the
     function as inline.


     Application I/O When Debugging Can Cause Screen Corruption
     ----------------------------------------------------------
     If an application executes an I/O operation when the Flip/Swap
     option is OFF, the screen may be corrupted.


     .COM Files
     ----------
     CodeView 4.01 does not show source code when debugging .COM files.  
     If you need to view source code, build your program as a small-model 
     .EXE for debugging purposes.


     Debugging Applications that Use a Mouse
     ---------------------------------------
     If you are using CV.EXE in a Windows MS-DOS session, and if you are
     debugging an application that uses or alters the mouse, you must
     specify the CodeView /M option to disable the mouse. This option is
     necessary because the DPMI services provided by Windows 3.x in
     enhanced mode do not allow for correctly saving and restoring the 
     mouse state.


     Debugging Code that Uses 32-Bit Registers
     -----------------------------------------
     CodeView 4.01 does not support single-stepping through code that
     uses 32-bit registers while a DPMI server is present.  Windows 3.1
     and 386-MAX are examples of DPMI servers.  If you need to single-
     step through 32-bit code, set breakpoints and use the F8 key for 
     single-stepping, or use an alternate debugger such as WDEB386 
     (available in the Microsoft Windows Software Development Kit).
     

     Debugging Locally on an 80286
     -----------------------------
     To run CodeView with Windows and debug locally on an 80286 computer,
     the following files must be installed on the host computer:

     - CVW4.EXE (CodeView kernel)
     - EEW0CXX.DLL (C++ expression evaluator)
     - EEW0CAN.DLL (ANSI C expression evaluator)
     - SHW0.DLL (symbol handler)
     - EMW0W0.DLL (Windows-Windows execution model)
     - TLW0LOC.DLL (local transport layer)
     - TOOLHELP.DLL (Toolhelp)


     Disable the Minimize On Use Option When Debugging
     -------------------------------------------------
     Running an application in CodeView for Windows can disable mouse and 
     keyboard control if the Minimize On Use option is set in the Windows 
     Program Manager.  This behavior occurs if you run an application 
     using F5, restart from the Run menu, and begin to debug the 
     application. To recover from this problem, use CTRL+ALT+SysRq to 
     stop the application, issue the WKA command from within Codeview for 
     Windows, and choose Exit from the File menu to return to Windows.

     
     MS-DOS Session Running in a Window Does Not Have Mouse Support
     --------------------------------------------------------------
     Running CodeView with the /2 option in an MS-DOS session window does
     not have mouse support. If you want mouse support, change the
     MS-DOS session to full screen.


     Recovering from "Internal Debugger Error"
     -----------------------------------------
     If CodeView generates an "Internal debugger error," restart your
     system.


     Remote Debugging with CodeView
     ------------------------------
     The required files needed on the host and the remote debugging
     machine are operating-system dependent.

     For running CodeView under MS-DOS, the following files must be
     installed on the MS-DOS host. These files are needed for all
     execution models:

     - CV.EXE (CodeView kernel)
     - SHD1.DLL (symbol handler)
     - EED1CXX.DLL or EED1CAN.DLL (C++ expression evaluator or ANSI C
       expression evaluator. Only one is needed, but EED1CXX.DLL
       is required for programming with C++.  EED1CXX.DLL is the only
       expression evaluator provided with MASM.)

     For remote debugging, you need to include the following statements in 
     the [RCVCOM] section of your TOOLS.INI file:

     parameters: com1:9600

     or specify the command line:

     RCVCOM [-p com1:4800] [-r] [-?]

     where [ ] represents an optional parameter. See page 370 in the
     Environment and Tools book for a description of these parameters.

     Remote debugging has three limitations:

     - You must specify that the shell be exclusive.

     - The recommended baud rate is 9600. If you experience any problems,
       try decreasing the baud rate.

     - The shell should be specified as full-screen.

     Specify these settings in a .PIF file or in an MS-DOS session. Use 
     the Settings command to specify these settings in an MS-DOS shell.

     If you install a CodeView DLL in a directory other than the one 
     in which Setup installs it, specify the path of the DLL with the 
     appropriate entry in your TOOLS.INI file. For example:

     SYMBOLHANDLER:C:\CV4\SHD1.DLL

     See also "Configuring CodeView with TOOLS.INI" on page 301, and
     "Remote Debugging" on page 367, both in the Environment and Tools
     book.

     The following four sections describe additional files you need for
     specific hosts and targets.


          DOS-Hosted, DOS-Targeted Debugging: Host Computer
          -------------------------------------------------
          If you are not doing remote debugging, these additional files
          must be installed on the host computer for DOS-hosted,
          DOS-targeted debugging:

          - EMD1D1.DLL (DOS host/DOS target execution model)
          - TLD1LOC.DLL (local transport layer)

          If you are doing remote debugging, these additional files must
          be installed on the host computer for DOS-hosted, DOS-targeted
          debugging:

          - EMD1D1.DLL (DOS host/DOS target execution model)
          - TLD1COM.DLL (COM port transport layer)

          To specify these transport options, use the TRANSPORT statement
          in your TOOLS.INI file. The path must be specified as follows:

          TRANSPORT:C:\CV4\DLL\TLD1COM.DLL COM1:9600

          If you do not specify COM#:baud_rate in the TRANSPORT statement,
          CodeView prompts you for this information.

          You must also add the Native entry to your TOOLS.INI file, giving
          the execution model. The path is required:

          NATIVE:C:\CV4\EMD1D1.DLL (for DOS host/DOS target execution model)


          DOS-Hosted, DOS-Targeted Debugging: Target Computer
          ---------------------------------------------------
          If you are doing remote DOS-hosted, DOS-targeted debugging, the 
          following file must be installed on the target computer:

          - RCVCOM.EXE (remote CodeView for COM port)


          DOS-Hosted, Windows-Targeted Debugging: Host Computer
          -----------------------------------------------------
          If you are doing remote debugging, these additional files must be
          installed on the host computer for DOS-hosted, Windows-targeted
          debugging:

          - EMD1W0.DLL (DOS host/Windows target execution model)
          - TLD1COM.DLL (COM port transport layer)


          DOS-Hosted, Windows-Targeted Debugging: Target Computer
          -------------------------------------------------------
          If you are doing remote debugging, the following additional files 
          must be installed on the target computer for DOS-hosted, Windows-
          targeted debugging:

          - RCVWCOM.EXE (remote CodeView for COM port)
          - DMW0.EXE (debug monitor on Windows target)
          - TOOLHELP.DLL (Toolhelp)


     Removing CodeView 3.07 from SDK Program Manager Group
     -----------------------------------------------------
     You can safely remove CodeView 3.07 from your SDK Program Manager 
     group to avoid confusion with the CodeView for Windows provided 
     with MASM or Microsoft C/C++.


     Running CodeView on an 80286 Computer
     -------------------------------------
     To run CVW on an 80286 computer, delete CVW.EXE and rename CVW4.EXE as
     CVW.EXE. Local debugging on an 80286 computer with an EGA adapter
     requires a secondary monitor. Single-screen debugging is not supported.
     Local debugging on an EGA system requires CodeView to be invoked with the 
     /2 command-line option.


     Running Screen-Saver Programs While Debugging
     ---------------------------------------------
     Do not run screen savers such as Idlewild or AfterDark while debugging; 
     their interactions with Windows can cause problems when debugging.


     Setting the Scope of the Show Address Option in CodeView
     --------------------------------------------------------
     The printed documentation and Help incorrectly list the
     syntax for setting the scope of the Show Address option in
     the CodeView Command window (OL) as

          OL[<scope>]

     instead of

          OL[[<scope>][+|-]].

     The + and - switches can be used to turn other options on or
     off, but will cause a syntax error if used to modify the scope
     of the Show Address option.

     You can choose several options for the OL command at the same time.
     Each time you use the OL command, the scopes you specify will be
     turned on and the scopes you don't specify will be turned off.
     The OL command does not toggle the scopes. For example, the command

          ollfg

     turns on lexical, function, and global scope while it turns off module
     and executable scope.


     .STARTUP Code
     -------------
     When CodeView information is generated in mixed-mode assembly, it
     is possible for CodeView .STARTUP code to be misplaced. For 
     example, from the source code

     .MODEL SMALL, C
     .STACK
     .CODE
             .STARTUP
             mov ax,0
             .EXIT
     END

     you would expect the following output:
     
     1:    .MODEL SMALL,C
     2:    .STACK
     3:    .CODE
     4:            .STARTUP
     214F:0000 BA5021         MOV       DX,2150
     214F:0003 8EDA           MOV       DS,DX
     214F:0005 8CD3           MOV       BX,SS
     214F:0007 2BDA           SUB       BX,DX
     214F:0009 D1E3           SHL       BX,1
     214F:000B D1E3           SHL       BX,1
     214F:000D D1E3           SHL       BX,1
     214F:000F D1E3           SHL       BX,1
     214F:0011 FA             CLI
     214F:0012 8ED2           MOV       SS,DX
     214F:0014 03E3           ADD       SP,BX
     214F:0016 FB             STI
     5:            mov ax,0
     214F:0017 B80000         MOV       AX,0000
     6:            .EXIT
     
     However, you will see the following:
     
     1:    .MODEL SMALL,C
     2:    .STACK
     3:    .CODE
     4:            .STARTUP
     5:            mov ax,0
     214F:0000 BA5021         MOV       DX,2150
     214F:0003 8EDA           MOV       DS,DX
     214F:0005 8CD3           MOV       BX,SS
     214F:0007 2BDA           SUB       BX,DX
     214F:0009 D1E3           SHL       BX,1
     214F:000B D1E3           SHL       BX,1
     214F:000D D1E3           SHL       BX,1
     214F:000F D1E3           SHL       BX,1
     214F:0011 FA             CLI
     214F:0012 8ED2           MOV       SS,DX
     214F:0014 03E3           ADD       SP,BX
     214F:0016 FB             STI
     214F:0017 B80000         MOV       AX,0000
     6:            .EXIT
     
     Note that line 5 has moved; however, the code will still run correctly.


     Unloading DLLs When CodeView Terminates
     ---------------------------------------
     You may have applications that use the LoadLibrary function to load
     DLLs to be used by the application. When CVW.EXE terminates or
     restarts such applications, Windows terminates the application without
     unloading DLLs or decrementing the DLL usage count. As a result, DLLs
     still exist in the system. To unload DLLs, you must either exit
     Windows and restart, or use a utility.


     Unsuccessful Connection to Remote Terminal
     ------------------------------------------
     A remote monitor may appear to hang (the screen clears except for 
     the CodeView sign-on banner) when connecting to it from a host computer
     that is running the debug kernel. In order to resolve this situation, 
     retry the connection when the debug kernel is not running on the 
     host computer.
