## About
Tornado is a combat flight simulator computer game by Digital
Integration that models the Panavia Tornado. It was released in 1993 for
MS-DOS and Amiga. Tornado is regarded by many as one of the best DOS
flight simulators of the 1990s.

The complete simulator consists of a powerful Advanced Mission Planner,
which was ahead of its time. The Mission Planner was more advanced than
what the RAF had back in 1993. Many regard Tornado has having the best
flight simulator mission planner for many years. The simulator also has
a dynamic campaign system. Among its other strengths are fast
flat-shaded graphics that give a real sense of speed at low-level, five
autopilot modes, accurate avionics and flight mechanics, multiple
weapons modeling, thousands of objects in the 3D environment and
classic 332-paged paper manual.
